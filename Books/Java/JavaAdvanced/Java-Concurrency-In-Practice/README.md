# Java Concurrenency and Multithreading :twisted_rightwards_arrows:

```

Concurrency and Multithreading are one of the most complecated and topics in Java. 
- Concurrency is the concept of executing two or more tasks at the same time (in parallel). 
Tasks may include methods (functions), parts of a program, or even other programs. 
With current computer architectures, support for multiple cores and multiple processors 
in a single CPU is very common.
- In Java, Multithreading refers to a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously 
for maximum utilization of the CPU. A thread in Java is a lightweight process requiring fewer 
resources to create and share the process resources.
